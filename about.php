<h2 style="font-size:40px; color:white;">Title: Knowledge Management Repository</h2>
 <p style="font-size:20px; color:white;">Problem: Need for a digital repository to store documents, photos, and videos and allow ease of access by keywords / topic.<br></br>
 Deliverable Format: Working prototype website / mobile app with the following
features:<br></br>
 a. User must be able to register on the system with Name, OpCo, and Enterprise
Email ID as mandatory fields (All are text fields).<br></br>

 b. User must be able to create a new folder and give it a unique event name – eg.
“Sales Productivity Kaizen”.<br></br>

 c. The user-created folder should automatically become a subfolder of the
repository’s standard folders named as per Year and Month eg. 2019-March.<br></br>

 d. User must be allowed to add requisite documents (PPT, Word, Excel, PDF),
photos, and event videos to the folder created by them.<br></br>
 e. All users have read-only access to all folders created by others.<br></br>
 f. Users can edit only those folders which they have themselves created.</p>
